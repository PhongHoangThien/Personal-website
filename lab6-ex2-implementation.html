                <p>
                    Mike, portrayed by actor Jonathan Banks, has been a key character throughout the series, 
                    known for his calm demeanor and pragmatic approach to the criminal activities he is involved in. 
                    In this particular episode, tensions rise as Mike plans to leave the meth business and retire with his earnings. 
                    However, Walter is determined to acquire the names of Mike's nine incarcerated men to eliminate potential witnesses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The confrontation takes place near a river, where Mike has been waiting for his go-bag to be delivered by his lawyer, 
                    Saul Goodman. As the conversation escalates and Mike refuses to provide the names, Walter, in a fit of rage, 
                    shoots him. Mike, realizing he is fatally wounded, retreats to a peaceful spot by the river to sit 
                    and contemplate his impending death.
